# Election Audit Summary
This script can be used for just about any election. You would just need to change the csv file name and with that you could do school elections, corporate elections too, and even state level elections too. 
You can also change the index number. For example if the index number is 1 or 2, then you would change it to 3 or 4. Or if there is a new election candidate on the docket then you could add their name and insert a new row for them like cadidate_name = row[5].
